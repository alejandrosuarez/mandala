    "# Changing `@op`s and managing versions\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing a value to the `deps_path` parameter of the `Storage` class enables\n",
    "dependency tracking and versioning. This means that any time a memoized function\n",
    "*actually executes* (instead of reusing a past call's results), it keeps track\n",
    "of the functions and global variables it accesses along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the functions we want to track are limited to user-defined ones (you\n",
    "typically don't want to track changes in installed libraries!):\n",
    "- Setting `deps_path` to `\"__main__\"` will only look for dependencies `f` defined in the current interactive session or process (as determined by `f.__module__`).\n",
    "- Setting it to a folder will only look for dependencies defined in this folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Caveat: The `@track` decorator\n",
    "The most efficient and reliable implementation of dependency tracking currently\n",
    "requires you to explicitly put `@track` on non-memoized functions and classes\n",
    "you want to track. This limitation may be lifted in the future, but at the cost\n",
    "of more magic (i.e., automatically applying the decorator to functions in the\n",
    "current local scope that originate in given paths).\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative (experimental) decorator implementation is based on\n",
    "`sys.settrace`. Limitations are described in this [blog\n",
    "post](https://amakelov.github.io/blog/deps/#syssettrace).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a version of an `@op`?\n",
    "A **version** for an `@op` is (to a first approximation) a collection of\n",
    "- hashes of the source code of functions and methods;\n",
    "- hashes of values of global variables\n",
    "\n",
    "accessed when a call to this `@op` was executed. Even if you don't change\n",
    "anything in the code, a single function can have multiple versions if it invokes\n",
    "different dependencies for different calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Versioning in action\n",
    "For example, consider this code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from sklearn.datasets import load_digits\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n",
    "from mandala.imports import Storage, op, track\n",
    "from typing import Tuple, Any\n",
    "\n",
    "N_CLASS = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "@track # to track a non-memoized function as a dependency\n",
    "def scale_data(X):\n",
    "    return StandardScaler(with_mean=True, with_std=False).fit_transform(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "@op\n",
    "def load_data():\n",
    "    X, y = load_digits(n_class=N_CLASS, return_X_y=True)\n",
    "    return X, y\n",
    "\n",
    "@op\n",
    "def train_model(X, y, scale=False):\n",
    "    if scale:\n",
    "        X = scale_data(X)\n",
    "    return LogisticRegression().fit(X, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "@op\n",
    "def eval_model(model, X, y, scale=False):\n",
    "    if scale:\n",
    "        X = scale_data(X)\n",
    "    return model.score(X, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "storage = Storage(deps_path='__main__')\n",
    "\n",
    "with storage:\n",
    "    X, y = load_data()\n",
    "    for scale in [False, True]:\n",
    "        model = train_model(X, y, scale=scale)\n",
    "        acc = eval_model(model, X, y, scale=scale)\n",
    "```\n",
    "When you run it, `train_model` and `eval_model` will each have two versions -\n",
    "one that depends on `scale_data` and one that doesn't. You can confirm this by\n",
    "calling `storage.versions(train_model)`. Now suppose we make some changes\n",
    "and re-run:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "N_CLASS = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "@track\n",
    "def scale_data(X):\n",
    "    return StandardScaler(with_mean=True, with_std=True).fit_transform(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "@op\n",
    "def eval_model(model, X, y, scale=False):\n",
    "    if scale:\n",
    "        X = scale_data(X)\n",
    "    return round(model.score(X, y), 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "with storage:\n",
    "    X, y = load_data()\n",
    "    for scale in [False, True]:\n",
    "        model = train_model(X, y, scale=scale)\n",
    "        acc = eval_model(model, X, y, scale=scale)\n",
    "```\n",
    "When entering the `storage` block, the storage will detect the changes in\n",
    "the tracked components, and for each change will present you with the functions\n",
    "affected:\n",
    "- `N_CLASS` is a dependency for `load_data`;\n",
    "- `scale_data` is a dependency for the calls to `train_model` and `eval_model`\n",
    "  which had `scale=True`;\n",
    "- `eval_model` is a dependency for itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantic vs content changes and versions\n",
    "For each change to the content of some dependency (the source code of a function\n",
    "or the value of a global variable), you can choose whether this content change\n",
    "is also a **semantic** change. A semantic change will cause all calls that\n",
    "have accessed this dependency to not appear memoized **with respect to the new\n",
    "state of the code**. The content versions of a single dependency are organized\n",
    "in a `git`-like DAG (currently, tree) that can be inspected using\n",
    "`storage.sources(f)` for functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Going back in time\n",
    "Since the versioning system is content-based, simply restoring an old state of\n",
    "the code makes the storage automatically recognize which \"world\" it's in, and\n",
    "which calls are memoized in this world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A warning about non-semantic changes\n",
    "The main motivation for allowing non-semantic changes is to maintain clarity in\n",
    "the storage when doing routine code improvements (refactoring, comments,\n",
    "logging). **However**, non-semantic changes should be applied with care. Apart from\n",
    "being prone to errors (you wrongly conclude that a change has no effect on\n",
    "semantics when it does), they can also introduce **invisible dependencies**:\n",
    "suppose you factor a function out of some dependency and mark the change\n",
    "non-semantic. Then the newly extracted function may in reality be a dependency\n",
    "of the existing calls, but this goes unnoticed by the system."
