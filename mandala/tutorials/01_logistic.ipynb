    "The project you just finished illustrated all the main features of\n",
    "`mandala`, and how they work together to enable a very simple and direct\n",
    "way of building and querying computational projects. While large-scale ML \n",
    "projects may require some additional patterns for properly using `mandala`, the\n",
    "patterns you have already seen can take you a long way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The importance of a good function decomposition\n",
    "Finally, it's a good time to reflect on something that often gets overlooked in\n",
    "ML, but is especially important when it comes to effective data management with\n",
    "`mandala`: **function decomposition**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decomposing a project like the above into functions (i.e., `generate_dataset`,\n",
    "`train_model`, `get_model_distance`) is something you often find yourself doing\n",
    "almost without thinking. It's a necessary practice for managing complexity in\n",
    "software engineering and ML experimentation in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is also particularly important to find a \"good\" decomposition when\n",
    "tracking experiments with `mandala`, because the kind of decomposition you use\n",
    "has consequences on the performance of your computations and storage system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider an alternative decomposition with a single function that\n",
    "does both the dataset generation and the model training:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def generate_and_train(n_samples, batch_size, learning_rate) -> Tuple[LogisticRegression, float]:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A frequent use case is to train many models on the same dataset, but with\n",
    "different hyperparameters. With a single function, you'd have to re-run the\n",
    "dataset generation function every time, even though the dataset is the same!\n",
    "\n",
    "This illustates the main principle of good function decomposition:\n",
    "**functions should be as small as possible, but no smaller**. It's best to pack\n",
    "independent units of work that you may want to combine in different ways into\n",
    "separate functions."
